# article_to_speech
I created this project as an interactive text-to-speech (TTS) system to make reading on my personal website more engaging, accessible, and immersive. My goal was to let users listen to articles, documents, and other written content while following along with highlighted words, creating a natural audio-visual reading experience that feels seamless.
